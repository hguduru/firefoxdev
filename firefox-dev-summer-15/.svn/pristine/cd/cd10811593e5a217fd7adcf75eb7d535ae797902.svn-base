Summer 2015 

1. Fix interface bugs.
    - play with the configuration page, and try to create different
       personas for browser. 
    - use the drag and drop interface to place urls into bins of
       personas 
    - document any bugs you see
    - we know that when there are a lot of urls in one persona, the page does not
       display the urls correctly, fix the bug

2. In the configuration page, add the functionality of porting users'
history to personas. This requires some interface design.

3(a). Improve the notification of uncategorized urls when user navigate
to those pages.
3(b). Improve the notification of the persona that the user is
currently in.

4. Upgrade the extension to the current version of FireFox

5. Port the extension to Chrome
