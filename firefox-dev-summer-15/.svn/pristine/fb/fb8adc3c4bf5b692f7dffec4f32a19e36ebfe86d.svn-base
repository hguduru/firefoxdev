multiple url patterns
  - fixed

  - due to xpcwrappednative being passed in emit function, not sure how to get around

  - fixed: permission changes take affect at time of asking not during next request

radio buttons on Mac are always finicky
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=643184
  - tried solution on last comment: adding css to xul browser
 
.menu-iconic-left { margin-left: -16px; margin-right: -16px; padding-left: 16px; }
.menu-iconic-icon { width:16px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; }

  - works better but not perfect

New window doesn't have tabbar button
  - fixed: no force in tbb argument

make new persona. then make new tab. Check mark for persona is by wrong one, but displays correctly in button

url rules are not perisistent across restarts
  - just tested, seems to work

on session restore, the persona is not saved

clear recent history doesn't work
  - just tested, seems to work
